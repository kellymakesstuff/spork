4. recipe detail page 
5. substitution search and detail page (including measurement conversion)
6. API crud options
7. CSS and flexbox
8. first screen with Carousel 
9. media query for mobile version

Order of functions (loool):
1. initialize git
2.build file structure 
3. build full backend 
4. Deploy full backend
5. Create react app
6. create all files (blank) 
7. create the service file 
8. build functions for CRUD in service file 
9. Get CRUD functionality working in respective components
10. Create the universal CSS 
11. Team splits to build components


Documents to track:
1. Workflow and Component progress
2. Class names 

Post MVP:
- filters on the search results 
- maybe authentication?! @Zain Sattar SEI-NY 

CRUD options:
UX team - where would you see most edit/delete/add options? possibly substitution page or recipe page?
