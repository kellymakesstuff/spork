## Sprint 1

Spork is being completed in consideration of the UX team's design vision and desired featured list as presented. The mission of sprint 1 was to get an MVP product that had its own backend, implemented a dual-feature search bar (both to search for recipes and ingredient substitutions), had screens for search results, substitutions, and individual recipes, and was responsive to tablet and mobile versions. 

Special thanks to the UX team for an incredible design and great teamwork. (They're also pretty funny.)

### MVP and Goals


1. Build backend with express and MongoDB
2. Two-function search bar
3. Recipe search results screen
4. Recipe detail screen
5. Substitution search and detail screen (including measurement conversion)
6. Responsive to tablet and mobile versions

### Server (Back End)

#### Database Schema

For recipes:
```
const Recipe = new Schema(
  {
    dishName: { type: String, required: true },
    imgUrl: { type: String, required: true },
    starRating: { type: Number, min: 0, max: 5, required: true },
    briefDescription: { type: String, required: true },
    ingredients: [{
      oneAmount: { type: String, required: true },
      oneUnit: { type: String, required: true },
      oneName: { type: String, required: true },
      twoAmount: { type: String, required: true },
      twoUnit: { type: String, required: true },
      twoName: { type: String, required: true },
      threeAmount: { type: String, required: true },
      threeUnit: { type: String, required: true },
      threeName: { type: String, required: true },
      fourAmount: { type: String, required: true },
      fourUnit: { type: String, required: true },
      fourName: { type: String, required: true },
      fiveAmount: { type: String, required: true },
      fiveUnit: { type: String, required: true },
      fiveName: { type: String, required: true },
      sixAmount: { type: String, required: false },
      sixUnit: { type: String, required: false },
      sixName: { type: String, required: false },
      sevenAmount: { type: String, required: false },
      sevenUnit: { type: String, required: false },
      sevenName: { type: String, required: false },
      eightAmount: { type: String, required: false },
      eightUnit: { type: String, required: false },
      eightName: { type: String, required: false },
    }],
    instructions: [{
      stepOne: { type: String, required: true },
      stepTwo: { type: String, required: true },
      stepThree: { type: String, required: true },
      stepFour: { type: String, required: true }
    }],
    prepTime: { type: String, required: true },
    comments: [{type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "comments" }]
  },
  { timestamps: true }
)

```

For comments:
```
const Comment = new Schema(
    {
        name: {type: String, required: true},
        comment: {type: String, required: true},
        starRating: {type: Number, required: true}

    },{
        timestamps: true
    }
)
```

### Express Routes

```
router.get('/recipes', controllers.getRecipes)
router.get('/recipes/:id', controllers.getRecipe)
router.post('/recipes', controllers.createRecipe)
router.put('/recipes/:id', controllers.updateRecipe)
router.delete('/recipes/:id', controllers.deleteRecipe)
router.post('/comments/:id', controllers.createComment)
//createComment would be the recipe _id
router.put('/comments/:id', controllers.updateComment)
//updateComment would be the comment _id
router.delete('/comments/:id', controllers.deleteComment)
//deleteComment would be the comment _id
```
