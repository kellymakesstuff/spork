## Sprint 1

Spork is being completed in consideration of the UX team's design vision and desired featured list as presented. The mission of sprint 1 was to get an MVP product that had its own backend, implemented a dual-feature search bar (both to search for recipes and ingredient substitutions), had screens for search results, substitutions, and individual recipes, and was responsive to tablet and mobile versions. 

Special thanks to the UX team for an incredible design and great teamwork. (They're also pretty funny.)
